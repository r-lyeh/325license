# Features
- Universal donors.
- Universal recipients.
- No clauses (optionally 1).
- No warranty.
- No liability.
- No attribution required (optional).

# Rationale
- Shortest free clause (from BSD license)
- Shortest legal text (from ZLIB license)
- If both sections above are orthogonal and OSI/FSF/GPL/DFSG compatible, this license *should* be OSI/FSF/GPL/DFSG compatible as well.
